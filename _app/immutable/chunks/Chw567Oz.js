<p>Because this is how Markdown works. If you are new to Markdown, I suggest you to go through <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown Guide</a>.</p>
<p><code>#</code> is used to create headings in Markdown. Either in Markdown or HTML we can have at most 6 levels of headings, aka. <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> - <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> in HTML.</p>
<p>In markmap, the concept of headings is weakened, but it still subjects to Markdown syntax. However you can use nested lists to create branches more than 6 levels.</p>
